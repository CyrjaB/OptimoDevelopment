So I decided to give my room a bit of a makeover, since I don't remember when was the last time i ever did anything in here. Plus, I'm really starving for some space. This is going to be sort of like a plan for this whole operation, so I don't end up winging it like usual. First things first, I'm going to paint the walls all white, as it supposedly makes the room appear more spacious than it is.
I'll also need to get a new cabinet for my underwear and some smaller things. I'm also getting a brand new closet for hoodies, pants, etc. Though there is a problem with that - I have no clue how I'm gonna fit it here without throwing out half the furniture I already have. I'll buy some shelves, mounted to the wall, for my books and other trinkets. A new desk could also go a long way, but it might have to wait as it just might tip over my budget. What I'm getting for sure though, is a new chair. The old one might just give me scoliosis if i use it any longer. And well that's about it I think.
